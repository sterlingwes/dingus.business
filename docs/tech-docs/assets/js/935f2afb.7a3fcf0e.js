You sacrifice some of the speed that comes with working directly with an interpreted language like Javascript, that on its own doesn\u2019t require compilation to see results, in exchange for some new language features, type safety and portability on platforms and browsers that don\u2019t support these transformations out of the box.","sidebar":"frontend"},"build-tools/babel":{"id":"build-tools/babel","title":"Babel","description":"A great way to see how Babel does code transformation (\u201dtranspilation\u201d) is to use Babel\u2019s REPL.
