# Frontend Frameworks

Frameworks allow you to build complex apps by encouraging a development pattern to follow while also providing some time saving shortcuts / APIs.

React has made the biggest impact of late in the way frontend apps are built, by encouraging the compartmentalization of UI into “components”, and taking over how the UI is rendered to allow developers to focus more on behaviours and states.

As frontend frameworks have become more powerful & responsible for more of the user’s experience, backends (servers, the cloud) have relinquished the responsibility of determining what the user sees (ie: sending browsers HTML files generated with data & content inline) and instead provide just the data the frontend needs to build dynamic UX.
